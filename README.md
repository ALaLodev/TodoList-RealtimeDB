# TodoList Andoid

Simple TodoList using Realtime database, Firebase's storage service.


The main idea of the project is the implementation of the non-relational db service Realtime DataBase from Firebase.
Recyclerview has been used for the optimization of the views. With the check button we create a golden border indicating that the task is done and by clicking on the trash can we remove the task from the list.
